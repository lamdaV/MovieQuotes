# MovieQuotes
[Demo](https://lamd-movie-quotes.firebaseapp.com/)

## Description:
This project was done to learn more about Angular + Firebase. This project is a simple dynamic archive of movie quotes and their corresponding movie. Reverse Pipe was experimented with during this project so that newly added quotes would appear at the top of the list. This project also incorporated bootstrap styling. Ontop of all this, simple Angular modifiers (ngFor, ngIf) were used to render elements accordingly.
